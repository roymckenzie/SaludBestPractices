#What is ¡Salud!?
A game to play with whoever, wherever whereby when someone sneezes and you say "¡Salud!" or any derivation of an exclamation of good will to someone who has just sneezed you gain one point.

#Rules
1. Only sneezes of other people will be counted as a point (you cannot "excuse" yourself to gain a point).
2. If you excuse yourself, that nullifies anyone from excusing you to gain a point.
3. The sneeze must be witnessed by one other acknowledged game player in order to be counted.
4. In the event of a tie, or what at least seems to be a tie, between the sneezer and saluder, the sneezer is given the victory and nullification. As this has a lesser impact.
5. The sneezing must happen at only a single agreed upon place in order to be counted as a true ¡Salud!
