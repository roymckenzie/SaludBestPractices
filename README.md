#What is ¡Salud!?
A game to play with whoever, wherever whereby when someone sneezes and you say "¡Salud!" or any derivation of an exclamation of good will to someone who has just sneezed you gain one point.

#Rules
1. Only sneezes of other people will be counted as a point (you cannot "excuse" yourself to gain a point).
2. If you excuse yourself, that nullifies anyone from excusing you to gain a point.
3. The sneeze must be witnessed by one other acknowledged game player in order to be counted.
4. In the event of a tie, or what at least seems to be a tie, between the sneezer and saluder, the sneezer is given the victory and nullification. As this has a lesser impact.
5. The sneezing must happen at only a single agreed upon place in order to be counted as a true ¡Salud!
6. In the event of a tie between two non-sneezers, the tie will go to the person who least changes the status quo of the current scores, except in the case where a point change will not effect rankings. In this case the point will default to the person with fewer points. In the event that someone is involved in a tie more than once in the same month, after the first tie they can request a coin flip, but only if the previous tie was not in their favor.  They can continue to request coin flips for subsequent ties in that same month, as long as they did not get the point in the previous tie and it is not the first tie they are involved in for that month.
7. Game points will reset at the first of the month, the person with the most points will get a "month" point, which is a secondary tally posted separate from the month's points(A good place can be under or above their name). A max of twelve "month" points can be awarded in a year.
