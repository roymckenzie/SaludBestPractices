#What is ¡Salud!?
A game to play with whoever, wherever whereby when someone sneezes and you say "¡Salud!" or any derivation of an exclamation of good will to someone who has just sneezed you gain one point.

#Rules
1. Only sneezes of other people will be counted as a point (you cannot "excuse" yourself to gain a point).
2. If you excuse yourself, that nullifies anyone from excusing you to gain a point.
3. The sneeze must be witnessed by one other acknowledged game player in order to be counted.
4. In the event of a tie, or what at least seems to be a tie, between the sneezer and saluder, the sneezer is given the victory and nullification. As this has a lesser impact.
5. The sneezing must happen at only a single agreed upon place in order to be counted as a true ¡Salud!
6. In the event of a tie between two non-sneezers, the tie will go to the person who least changes the status quo of the current scores, except in the case where a point change will not effect rankings. In this case the point will default to the person with fewer points. In the event that someone is involved in a tie more than once in the same month, after the first tie they can request a coin flip, but only if the previous tie was not in their favor.  They can continue to request coin flips for subsequent ties in that same month, as long as they did not get the point in the previous tie and it is not the first tie they are involved in for that month.
7. Game points will reset at the first of the month, the person with the most points will get a "month" point, which is a secondary tally posted separate from the month's points(A good place can be under or above their name). A max of twelve "month" points can be awarded in a year.
8. When a month finishes and a winner is declared for that month, take the difference between the first place score and second place score, then divide that number by two and round down.  All players, except for that months winner, will start off the new month with this score. The previous winner's starting score will be zero.  If it is the first month of the game, everyone's scores will all start at zero. This headstart rule only applies if the difference between first and second place is five points or more.
9. If a player recognizes they are about to sneeze they are not allowed to notify another player, thus giving a clear advantage, be it through text, words, or gesturing -except for gestures used in their otherwise normal sneezing pattern.  After the sneeze is completed however, if no one noticies the act and no one calls out salud-or variant there of-, and the sneezer also does not call out salud- or variant there of-, they can choose to reveal that the sneeze has occured to anyone in any form they choose.  If however they use the word salud -or variant there of- in the process of informing someone else, even using text, the point is nullified by the sneezer.

//Todo:
//-need clearer rules for preventing alliances, and telling someone before you are about to sneeze
//-need clear rules for giving/trading points.
